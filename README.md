## Background

[Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html) is a massively popular web-based [word game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle) initially created by Welsh software engineer [Josh Wardle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josh_Wardle) and currently owned by the [New York Times Company](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/31/business/media/new-york-times-wordle.html). Since the game's incepetion, many clones and similar spin-off games have been created - perhaps the largest listing of all such games can be found at the [Wordleverse website](https://wordleverse.net/).

In March of 2022, it seemed that the Wordleverse had a dearth of movie-related Wordle spin-offs. With the [94th Academy Awards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/94th_Academy_Awards) (popularly known as the Oscars) quickly approaching, the timing seemed perfect for a Hollywood-themed Wordle-like game to enter the Wordleverse.

Originally the brainchild of Alex Jaloza, Hollywoodle provides users two new daily actors to link either by movie or by co-star with the fewest possible guesses. The user is given points for each guess - 10 points for a correct guess, 30 points for an incorrect guess, and 20 points for a guess of a movie that only features the final actor and not the first or current one (partial credit). If a user needs a hint they are penalized 30 points.

In essence, the objective of the game is to score as few points as possible with the fewest guesses as possible.

## Functionality

Hollywoodle is built with the [MERN](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/mern-stack/) stack and features a React-Typescript front-end with a Node/Express Typescript server linked to a [MongoDB Atlas Database](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/lp/try2?utm_source=google&utm_campaign=gs_americas_united_states_search_core_brand_atlas_desktop&utm_term=mongodb%20atlas&utm_medium=cpc_paid_search&utm_ad=e&utm_ad_campaign_id=12212624338&adgroup=115749704063&gclid=CjwKCAjwuYWSBhByEiwAKd_n_lJ4kymFETif8K0fhDtRPrhaNIB_lQsxRKht4u1YhiX-tQDOXAwD2hoCS9kQAvD_BwE). The application can be broken down into two parts:

### Server-side

- Uses the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/people/get-popular-people) to update and store the details of two popular actors (including names, images, TMDB IDs, genders, and most popular recent movie data) in a MongoDB Atlas Database every night at midnight ET.
- Queries the MongoDB database to send that actor data to the front-end.

### Client-side

- Requests actor data from the backend and renders details about the initial and final actor for the user to guess the relation.
- Sets a [dark/light-mode](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-dark-mode-on-the-web/) theme based on the user's native preferred specification (although this can also be manually toggled by the user).
- Uses React's [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to store and access widely-used state variables such as points and dark-mode configuration throughout the application.
- [Autosuggests](https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest) movies or actors (details of which are once again fetched from TMDB) based on a user's search input.
- Determines the correctness of a user's guess selection by means of movie cast ID lookup that searches for a match using TMDB's movie and actor IDs.
- Displays a popcorn emoji (üçø) [confetti rain effect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-rewards) when a user successfuly links the first given actor with the final given actor.
